<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

The Sales Performance Dashboard is an interactive Power BI report designed to analyze product sales transactions and revenue performance. The dashboard provides a consolidated view of total orders, net sales, gross sales, product performance, regional distribution, and daily sales trends.
It enables stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), evaluate product demand, analyze state-wise revenue contribution, and track order status efficiently. The dashboard transforms raw sales data into actionable insights that support data-driven business decisions.



<h2><a class="anchor" id="business-problem"></a>Business Problem</h2>

Sales-driven businesses generate large volumes of transactional data but often lack a centralized system to analyze it effectively. Decision-makers require quick answers to questions such as:<br>
-Which products are generating the highest sales?<br>
-What is the total net and gross revenue?<br>
-How do sales vary day by day?<br>
-Which states contribute the most to overall revenue?<br>
-What percentage of orders are successful, pending, or failed?<br>
Without an interactive dashboard, extracting such insights becomes manual, time-consuming, and inefficient.<br>
This project solves the problem by presenting all key sales insights in a single, interactive Power BI dashboard that allows dynamic filtering and quick performance monitoring.
